    <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#D00000">R<FONT SIZE="-1">C5-32/12/8</FONT></FONT> is a type of encryption. Encryption is a way to scramble data so that only one person (or computer) can descramble it. <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA Data Security</A> has sponsored a challenege to find the correct key out of 2<SUP>64</SUP>. The object of the <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/97challenge/">RSA Challenege</A> is to show that current encryption techniques just aren't good enough.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#D00000">W<FONT SIZE="-1">E ARE PART</FONT></FONT> of the <A HREF="http://www.distributed.net/rc5/">Bovine</A> effort to crack the code. The Bovine Keyserver sends each member of the team a range of blocks (2<SUP>30</SUP> keys) to crack. We then use their program to calculate each key. If one of them is the right one, RSA will give out $10,000. Six thousand dollars for a charity, $2,000 for Bovine, and $2,000 for us.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#D00000">T<FONT SIZE="-1">HERE WERE OTHER</FONT></FONT> groups trying to crack the code as well. None of them have decided to take up RC5-64 though.</BLOCKQUOTE>
